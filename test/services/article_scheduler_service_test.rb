  # NOTE: This test would pass if in the ArticleSchedularService we did like
  # article.create_schedule!(
  #     time: DateTime.parse(article_params[:scheduled_time]),
  #     job_id: job.job_id)
  # instead of job.provider_job_id
  # Can fix for now like this, job_id: job.provider_job_id || job.job_id, but not correct.

  # This is happening because if I make a request using the controller,
  # then a provider_job_id is present on the job created which I'm storing
  # and later using to find the job and delete it if needed.
  # But if I'm calling this service from this test. Then the provider_job_id is not present on the job created.
